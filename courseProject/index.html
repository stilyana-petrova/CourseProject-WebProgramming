             <p class="pp"> His great artistic talent, especially a gift for drawing, was observed by  Marek Czechowicz, plastic art teacher in primary school in Baborów. Czechowicz’s creative activity was the first serious artistic inspiration. Czechowicz was also the first person who helped talented young man to deepen his knowledge of practical skills in oil painting. He taught Damian Lechoszest in his own private painter’s studio. </p>

            <h4>INTERVIEW</h4>
            <p class="pp"><b> - It is said your are a perfectionist, you destroyed many of your painting.</b></p>

            <p class="pp">  Yes. I am able to destroy a big painting and start from scratch if I know what the problem is and how to solve it. But it is not always the case, we are not always able to predict everything. Such paintings do not leave my studio and land in the oven.</p>
            <p class="pp p2"><b>- How long does the process of creating last?</b></p>

            <p class="pp">   Every painting is different. The average-sized needs two or three weeks to be finished. I do not hurry at work, it is not my aim to finish the painting in two or three days. The only purpose is to delight and enchant the viewer.</p>
        
            <p class="pp p2"><b>- Is the creative work a kind of struggle or does it come to you easily?</b></p>

            <p class="pp"> To me, the process of painting is a form of meditation. There are two ways of painting. The first is ‘to paint ’ and the second is ‘painting’. The difference does not appear to be large, but it is essential, as the second becomes a form of a presence. You need to be here and now, aware of each an every move. Each brushstroke counts.</p>
            
            <p class="pp p2"><b>- What kind of canvas you use how does it impact the picture visually?</b></p>

              <p class="pp">  I prepare the canvas myself, for two reasons: I have influence on the canvas and the way it is strained. I use the canvas of a Belgian company. This is a so-called life-like weave. It gives the whole piece an organic look. It is handmade and has absorption and grip which help me work best.</p>
